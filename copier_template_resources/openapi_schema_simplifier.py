It is excluded from coverage checks in other repos, so be cautious about making changes downstream as opposed to the copier base template...really it's for parsing OpenAPI schema...so I can't think of a reason you'd need custom changes that are repo-specific that shouldn't be backported to the template

    Pydantic v2 emits ``Optional[X]`` as a composed ``anyOf`` (OpenAPI 3.1 dropped the ``nullable`` keyword). The two
    spellings are equivalent, but the composed form trips some codegen tools — Kiota, for example, only recognizes
    nullability in the type-array form and otherwise generates empty ``Member1`` wrapper types. The rewrite is only
    applied when it is lossless: members carrying ``enum``/``const`` (which apply across every type) or non-typed
    members (e.g. ``$ref``) are left as ``anyOf``. Operates in place on any OpenAPI document, including ones produced
    by servers we do not control.
